I am a Master of Applied Science student and Research Assistant at the University of British Columbia, 
working with Professor Mieszko Lis. My research is currently focused on the intersection of computer architecture 
and machine learning. Specifically, we:

* explore software/hardware co-design approaches to come up with faster and more efficient solutions
* design application specific architectures to accelerate machine learning inference
* explore acceleration of emerging training procedures (e.g. second order methods) for artificial neural networks
