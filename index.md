I am a Master of Applied Science student and Research Assistant at the University of British Columbia, 
working with Professor [Mieszko Lis](http://mieszko.ece.ubc.ca/). My research is currently focused on the intersection of computer architecture 
and machine learning. Specifically, we:

* explore software/hardware co-design approaches to come up with faster and more efficient solutions
* design application specific architectures to accelerate machine learning inference
* explore acceleration of emerging training procedures (e.g. second order methods) for artificial neural networks
